# rop-emporium

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [rop-emporium](https://ropemporium.com/) ROP (Return Oriented Programming) challenges.

## Running solutions

Building the solutions is as easy as writing `make` in the given challenge directory. `ret2win` example:

```bash
cd ret2win/
make
```
